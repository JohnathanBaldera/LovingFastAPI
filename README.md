# Building APIs Everyone Loves with FastAPI

This Repo was created for The Austin Python Meetup Monthly Meetup (January 12th, 2022)

[Check out the Presentation Slides here]("https://tinyurl.com/lovingFastAPI")

## Description

FastAPI is a framework that has been growing extremely fast within the Python Community. Clearly loved by developers and organizations that have decided to use it, but why? First, it is an easy framework to learn. You can build your first api with FastAPI in 10 lines. Businesses love it because developers can build quickly with it. Development teams love it because there is no longer a need to spend so much time writing and updating documentation. The talk will go over building an API with FastAPI and how the features within FastAPI make it easy to use, help you to develop quickly and how to document and add enhancements to FastAPI's already amazing auto-docs feature.
